    "description": "The process for addressing software security is defined, published internally, and broadcast to all stakeholders so that everyone knows the plan. Goals, roles, responsibilities, and activities are explicitly defined. Most organizations examine existing methodologies, such as the NIST SSDF, Microsoft SDL, or Synopsys Touchpoints, then tailor them to meet their needs. Security activities will be adapted to software lifecycle processes (e.g., waterfall, Agile, CI/CD, DevOps), so activities will evolve with both the organization and the security landscape. The process doesn\u2019t need to be publicly promoted outside the firm to have the desired impact (see [SM3.2]). In addition to publishing the written process, some firms also automate parts (e.g., a testing strategy) as governance-as-code (see [SM3.4])."

Go beyond reporting of open and closed defects to educate executives on the business risks, including risks of adopting emerging engineering technologies and methodologies without security oversight. Demonstrate a worst-case scenario in a controlled environment with the permission of all involved (e.g.,by showing attacks and their business impact). Presentation to the Board can help garner resources for new or ongoing SSI efforts. Demonstrating the need for new skill-building training in evolving areas, such as DevOps groups using cloud-native technologies, can help convince leadership to accept SSG recommendations when they might otherwise be ignored in favor of faster release dates or other priorities.

    "description": "The software security process includes checkpoints (such as gates, release conditions, guardrails, milestones, etc.) at one or more points in a software lifecycle. The first two steps toward establishing security-specific checkpoint conditions are to identify process locations that are compatible with existing development practices and to then begin gathering the information necessary, such as risk-ranking thresholds or defect data, to make a go/no-go decision. Importantly, the conditions need not be enforced at this stage\u2014e.g.,  the SSG can collect security testing results for each project prior to release, then provide an informed opinion on what constitutes sufficient testing or acceptable test results without trying to stop a project from moving forward (see [SM2.2]). Shorter release cycles might require creative approaches to collecting the right evidence and rely heavily on automation. Socializing the conditions and then enforcing them once most project teams already know how to succeed is a gradual approach that motivates good behavior without introducing unnecessary friction."

Use internal policies and standards, regulations, contractual agreements, and other obligations to define release conditions, then track all exceptions. Verifying conditions yields data that informs the KRIs and any other metrics used to govern the process. Automatically giving software a passing grade or granting exceptions without due consideration defeats the purpose of verifying conditions. Even seemingly innocuous  software projects (e.g., small code changes, infrastructure access control changes, deployment blueprints) must successfully satisfy the prescribed security conditions as they progress through the software lifecycle. Similarly, APIs, frameworks, libraries, bespoke code, microservices, container configurations, etc. are all software that must satisfy security release conditions. It\u2019s possible, and often very useful, to have verified the conditions both before and after the development process itself. In modern development environments, the verification process will increasingly become automated (see [SM3.4])."

Forming this social network of advocates, sometimes referred to as champions, is a good step toward scaling security into software engineering. One way to build the initial group is to track the people who stand out during introductory training courses (see [T3.6]). Another way is to ask for volunteers. In a more top-down approach, initial satellite membership is assigned to ensure  good coverage of development groups, but ongoing membership is based on actual performance. The satellite can act as a sounding board for new projects and, in new or fast-moving technology areas, can help combine software security skills with domain knowledge that might be under-represented in the SSG or engineering teams. Agile coaches, scrum masters, and DevOps engineers can make particularly useful satellite members, especially for detecting and removing process friction.

For some software lifecycle phases, humans are no longer the primary drivers of progression from one phase to the next.

Automation often extends beyond the scope of CI/ CD to include functional and nonfunctional aspects of delivery, such as health checks, cut-over on failure, rollback to known-good state, defect discovery and management, compliance verification, and a way to ensure adherence to policies and standards. Some organizations are also evolving their lifecycle management approach by integrating their compliance and defect discovery data, perhaps augmented by intelligence feeds and other external data, to begin moving from a series of point-in-time go/no-go decisions (e.g., release conditions) to a future state of continuous accumulation of assurance data (see [CMVM3.6])."

Simply republishing items from public mailing lists doesn\u2019t achieve the same benefits as active and ongoing discussions, nor does a closed discussion hidden from those creating code and configurations. Everyone should feel free to ask questions and learn about vulnerabilities and exploits."

    "description": "The SSG arms engineers, testers, and incident response with automation to mimic what attackers are going to do. For example, a new attack method identified by an internal research group (see [AM2.8]) or a disclosing third party could require a new tool, so the SSG, perhaps through the champions, could package the tool and distribute it to testers. The idea here is to push attack capability past what typical commercial tools and offerings encompass, then make that knowledge and technology easy for others to use. Mimicking attackers, especially attack chains, almost always requires tailoring tools to a firm\u2019s particular technology stacks, infrastructure, and configurations. When technology stacks and coding languages evolve faster than vendors can innovate, creating tools and automation in-house might be the best way forward. In the DevOps world, these tools might be created by engineering and embedded directly into toolchains and automation (see [ST3.6])."

For example, if the organization\u2019s cloud software relies on a cloud vendor\u2019s security apparatus (e.g., key and secrets management), the SSG or appropriate SMEs can help catalog the quirks of the crypto package and how it might be exploited. Attack patterns directly related to the security frontier (e.g., AI, serverless) can be useful here as well. It\u2019s often easiest to start with existing generalized attack patterns to create the needed technologyspecific ones, but simply adding \u201cfor microservices\u201d at the end of a generalized pattern name, for example, won\u2019t suffice.

    "description": "Security-aware reviewers identify application security features, review these features against application security requirements and runtime parameters, and determine if each feature can adequately perform its intended function\u2014usually collectively referred to as threat modeling. The goal is to quickly identify missing security features and requirements, or bad deployment configuration (authentication, access control, use of cryptography, etc.), and address them. For example, threat modeling would identify both a system that was subject to escalation of privilege attacks because of broken access control as well as a mobile application that incorrectly puts PII in local storage. Use of the firm\u2019s secure-bydesign components often streamlines this process (see [SFD2.1]). Many modern applications are no longer simply \u201c3-tier\u201d but instead involve components architected to interact across a variety of tiers\u2014 browser/endpoint, embedded, web, microservices, orchestration engines, deployment pipelines, third-party SaaS, etc. Some of these environments might provide robust security feature sets, whereas others might have key capability gaps that require careful analysis, so organizations should consider the applicability and correct use of security features across all tiers that constitute the architecture and operational environment."

It\u2019s important to document both the architecture under review and any security flaws uncovered, as well as risk information that people can understand and use.

Standardizing architecture descriptions between those who generate the models and those who analyze and annotate them makes analysis more tractable and scalable. High-level network diagrams, data flow, and authorization flows are always useful, but the model should also go into detail about how the software itself is structured. A standard architecture description can be enhanced to provide an explicit picture of information assets that require protection, including useful metadata. Standardized icons that are consistently used in diagrams, templates, and dry-erase board squiggles are especially useful, too."

Note that security design patterns can interact in surprising ways that break security, so apply analysis processes even when vetted design patterns are in standard use. For cloud services, providers have learned a lot about how their platforms and services fail to resist attack and have codified this experience into patterns for secure use.

Over time, QA teams learn the security mindset, and the organization benefits from an improved ability to create security tests tailored to the organization\u2019s code."

An event here is simply a noteworthy occurrence, such as dropping new code in a repository, a pull request, a build request, or a push to deployment. Event-driven testing implemented in pipeline automation (rather than testing only in production) typically moves the testing closer to the conditions driving the testing requirement (whether shift left toward design or shift right toward operations), repeats the testing as often as the event is triggered, and helps ensure that the right testing is executed for a given set of conditions. Success with this approach depends on the broad use of sensors (e.g., agents, bots) that monitor engineering processes, execute contextual rules, and provide telemetry to automation that initiates the specified testing whenever event conditions are met.

    "description": "The organization ensures the integrity of software it builds and integrates by maintaining and securing all development infrastructure and preventing unauthorized changes to source code and other software lifecycle artifacts. Development infrastructure includes code and artifact repositories, build pipelines, and deployment automation. Secure the development infrastructure by safely handling and storing secrets, following pipeline configuration requirements, patching tools and build environments, limiting access to pipeline settings, and auditing changes to configurations. Preventing unauthorized changes typically includes enforcing least privilege access to code repositories and requiring approval for code commits. Automatically granting access for all project team members isn\u2019t sufficient to adequately protect software integrity."

    "description": "When a security defect is found in operations (see [CMVM1.2]), the organization searches for and fixes all occurrences of the defect in operations, not just the one originally reported. Doing this proactively requires the ability to reexamine the entire operations software inventory (see [CMVM2.3]) when new kinds of defects come to light. One way to approach reexamination is to create a ruleset that generalizes deployed defects into something that can be scanned for via automated code review. In some environments, addressing a defect might involve removing it from production immediately and making the actual fix in some priority order before redeployment. Use of orchestration can greatly simplify deploying the fix for all occurrences of a software defect (see [SE2.7])."

To make this process systematic, the incident response postmortem includes a feedback-to-SSDL step. The outcomes of the postmortem might result in changes such as to tool-based policy rulesets in a CI/CD pipeline and adjustments to automated deployment configuration (see [SE2.2]). This works best when root-cause analysis pinpoints where in the software lifecycle an error could have been introduced or slipped by uncaught (e.g., a defect escape). DevOps engineers might have an easier time with this because all the players are likely involved in the discussion and the solution. An ad hoc approach to SSDL improvement isn\u2019t sufficient for prevention."

    "description": "The SSG simulates high-impact software security crises to ensure that software incident detection and response capabilities minimize damage. Simulations could test for the ability to identify and mitigate specific threats or could begin with the assumption that a critical system or service is already compromised and evaluate the organization\u2019s ability to respond. Planned chaos engineering can be effective at triggering unexpected conditions during simulations. The exercises must include attacks or other software security crises at the appropriate software layer to generate useful results (e.g., at the application layer for web applications and at lower layers for IoT devices). When simulations model successful attacks, an important question to consider is the time required for clean up. Regardless, simulations must focus on security-relevant software failure, not on natural disasters or other types of emergency response drills. Organizations that are highly dependent on vendor infrastructure (e.g., cloud service providers, SaaS, PaaS) and security features will naturally include those things in crisis simulations."
